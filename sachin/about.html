			<div class="bio"> 
				Hello! Its me Sachin Khanal and freshly I am studying BSC(hons)Computing in Nami college. Lots of people
			explain themself being this and that but as in myself I just want to be a person that know the value of time and interest that keeps his/her life obstinate which is far better than ranking with luxurious life. Like everyone I have an aim to be a software engineer. I live in chabahil,kathmandu. Besides education I like playing games, singing songs , i like to travel in new places and i also love doing photography. Whenever I am low I just take a copy and pen and start writing songs about some moments that strokes a memorable part in my life.
